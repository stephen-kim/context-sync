Claustrum is a shared memory layer for AI systems. It integrates context across projects, tools, and teams.


## What This Project Does

- Shares memory context across multiple computers and developers.
- Keeps MCP workflows production-safe (`stdout` clean, policy-driven behavior).
- Provides team operations via Admin UI (workspace/project/user/permissions/audit).
- Supports external context sources (Notion, Jira, Confluence, Linear, Slack).


## Why This Exists

AI coding context often gets fragmented:

- each machine has different memory state
- each teammate sees different context
- project decisions are lost in commits/chats/docs

Claustrum turns that into a shared, queryable memory system for teams.


## Core Components

- **Memory Core**: REST API + policy + Postgres storage.
- **MCP Adapter**: stdio MCP bridge to Memory Core.
- **Admin UI**: management dashboard for teams.
- **Shared Package**: schemas/types/utilities used across apps.
