  // ========== MEMORY ==========
  {
    name: 'remember',
    description: `Store important context about the project. Use when the user shares something that matters for future sessions: active work, architectural constraints, problems encountered, goals, decisions, notes, or **caveats** (AI mistakes/tech debt).

** NEW: CAVEAT TYPE - Track AI Mistakes & Tech Debt**

When you (the AI) realize something went wrong, ALWAYS call remember with type='caveat':
- You tried something that didn't work
- You took a shortcut instead of proper solution  
- You made changes but didn't verify them
- You made assumptions that might be wrong
- You used a workaround instead of fixing root cause

**Caveat Categories:**
- **mistake**: Tried X, got error Y, did workaround Z (not ideal)
- **shortcut**: Skipped proper testing/verification to save time
- **unverified**: Made changes but didn't build/test/verify
- **assumption**: Assumed X works without checking
- **workaround**: Fixed symptom but not root cause

**Caveat Metadata (REQUIRED):**
- **severity**: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical'
- **attempted**: What you tried to do
- **error**: What went wrong (if applicable)
- **recovery**: What you did instead
- **verified**: true/false - Did you test the recovery?
- **action_required**: What user needs to do (e.g., "Restart MCP server")
- **affects_production**: true/false - Will users hit this issue?

**Example - Git Tool MCP Issue:**
\`\`\`typescript
remember(
  type: 'caveat',
  content: 'Git tool updated with 6 new actions but MCP validation fails',
  metadata: {
    category: 'unverified',
    severity: 'medium',
    attempted: 'Test new git actions via MCP',
    error: 'Schema validation error - actions not in allowed values',
    recovery: 'Created manual test script instead',
    verified: true, // Test script worked
    action_required: 'User must restart MCP server for new actions to work',
    affects_production: true // MCP users affected until restart
  }
)
\`\`\`

**When to Use Caveats:**
 "Actually, I realize..."  CAVEAT
 "Let me try a different approach..."  CAVEAT (first approach failed)
 "Hmm, that didn't work..."  CAVEAT
 "Wait, on second thought..."  CAVEAT (assumption was wrong)
 Made changes but didn't run build/test  CAVEAT (unverified)
 Used workaround instead of proper fix  CAVEAT (shortcut)

**This makes Context Sync the FIRST tool to track AI mistakes as technical context!**

**Command Language:** Users may say "cs remember" (git-style command). When they do, analyze the conversation and save relevant context.

**AI-Driven Checkpoint Mode:**
When the user says "cs remember" or "remember this conversation" WITHOUT specifying type/content, YOU (the AI) should:

1. **Analyze the Recent Conversation** (last 5-10 messages)
2. **Extract Context Categories:**
   - Active Work: What task is currently being worked on? Files being edited? Branch name?
   - Constraints: Any architectural rules, technology choices, or limitations mentioned?
   - Problems: Blockers, bugs, errors, or issues discussed?
   - Goals: Targets with deadlines? Features to build?
   - Decisions: Important choices made with reasoning?
   - Notes: Other important information worth remembering?
   - **Caveats**: AI mistakes, workarounds, unverified changes?

3. **Call remember() Multiple Times** - Once per item extracted, with structured data:
   - Type: Choose the appropriate category
   - Content: Clear, specific description (1-2 sentences)
   - Metadata: Include file paths, code snippets, links, or other relevant context

**Example Checkpoint Analysis:**
If conversation discusses "building the TypeScript server with 8 core tools, tested successfully via MCP":
- Call remember(type="active_work", content="Building Context Sync server with 8 core tools (set_project, remember, recall, etc.)", metadata={files: ["src/server.ts", "src/core-tools.ts"]})
- Call remember(type="decision", content="Reduced from 50+ tools to 8 core tools, moved rest to internal utilities for simplicity", metadata={reasoning: "Users overwhelmed by too many tools"})
- Call remember(type="active_work", content="Testing implementation via MCP protocol in Cursor", metadata={status: "All 8 tools tested successfully"})

**When to Use Checkpoint Mode:**
- User says "cs remember" with no arguments
- User says "remember this conversation" or "save this session"
- User asks to checkpoint progress before switching tasks
- End of significant work session

**When to Use Direct Mode:**
- User specifies what to remember: "cs remember: using TypeScript for the server"
- Clear type indicated: "cs constraint: must support SQLite"
- Single piece of information to save

This approach leverages YOUR (the AI's) conversation understanding while keeping the server as simple storage.`,
